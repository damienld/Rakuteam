# Multimodal Product Data Classification
<br>
In order to complete training as a Data Scientist, we developped this project as a team of 4 people.<br>
For this [contest organized by ENS](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/35/), we worked on the classification of e-commerce articles by aggregating several models.<br>
The data provided for each article included both some text(title and description) and a picture.
